# EIGHTBIO
## Eightbio is a deeplearning model used to predict NinetyGL events
----------
This predictive artificial intelligence model is based on a system 
architecture which depends on several python language libraries and whose version
compatibility must be respected to be executed.
It is for these reasons that the Docker type container system was chosen to deploy this mathematical model.
Indeed, this model uses the python language version 3.7.3 with interdependent of distinct libraries. 
For the good functionality of the program, these libraries must be installed with specific versions to be compatible, 
such as: tensorflow version 2.0.0, scikit-learn version 0.21.2, keras version 2.3.1 and numpy version 1.16.4.
The Docker container will be able to build a system encompassing all these dependencies of mathematical libraries.
